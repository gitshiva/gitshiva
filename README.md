- 👋 Hi, I’m @gitshiva
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology & physics. Fun fact: Universe is ~13.77 billion years old, the universe itself is ~ 96 billion lights years in diameter .. yeah, I know, crazy right?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang http://golang.org and recursion :-(, I know I didn't do it right the first time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving business problems and how to scale things WARNING: it requires deep thinking and modeling.
- 📫 I'm reachable via snail mail (love post cards!), e-mail <s h i v a a t s u b b u d o t us>, or LN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/subramanian
